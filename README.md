# Distributed Key Generation

:warning: Under Construction
> This crate is actively being developed. Breaking changes will occur until mainnet when we will start [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Distributed key-generator of [Radius Block Building Solution](https://github.com/radiusxyz/radius-docs-bbs/blob/main/docs/radius_block_building_solution.md) written in Rust programming language.

Distributed Key Generator is an implementation of aggregated encryption/decryption mechanism which generates both keys at a regular interval. At each interval, an encryption key and its ID pair is generated and made accessible to other entities such as Secure RPC. A decryption key is generated only after a certain amount of time and can be accessed using the corresponding encryption key ID.

## Running the DKG tests

Execute the tests in singleâ€‘threaded mode:

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

If the tests don't exit, run the following command to kill all related processes:
`pkill -f key-generator`
